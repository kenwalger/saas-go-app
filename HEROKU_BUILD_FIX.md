# Heroku Build Fix - Alternative Approach

The `compile` script in the root wasn't working. Here's an alternative approach that should work better.

## Solution: Use Heroku's Go Buildpack with Package Path

Heroku's Go buildpack can be configured using environment variables. However, the simplest solution is to ensure the buildpack can find and build your main package.

## Option 1: Move main.go to Root (Simplest)

If the buildpack continues to have issues, the simplest solution is to move `main.go` to the root:

```bash
# Move main.go to root
mv cmd/server/main.go ./main.go

# Update imports if needed (they should still work)
# Then update Procfile to just: web: saas-go-app
```

## Option 2: Use Custom Buildpack or Build Script

The current setup uses `bin/compile` which should work, but if it doesn't, we can:

1. Use a custom buildpack
2. Use a build script in package.json (if using Node buildpack first)
3. Use Docker deployment instead

## Option 3: Set GO_INSTALL_PACKAGE_PATH (Current Attempt)

We've set up `bin/compile` to build the binary. If this doesn't work, try setting the environment variable on Heroku:

```bash
heroku config:set GO_INSTALL_PACKAGE_PATH=./cmd/server --app saas-go-app
```

## Current Setup

- `Procfile`: `web: ./bin/saas-go-app`
- `bin/compile`: Builds the binary from `./cmd/server`
- The buildpack should execute `bin/compile` during build

If this still doesn't work, we should move `main.go` to the root as it's the most reliable approach for Heroku.
